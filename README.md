# Gun-Violence-in-USA
In this Python portfolio project, I explore the analysis of U.S. gun violence data using Python in Jupyter Notebooks. This repo includes data exploration, statistical analysis, and visualizations to identify trends and insights on incident frequency and impact.

## Objectives
The project aims to analyze gun violence incidents in the USA from January 2013 to March 2018, seeking to identify patterns and trends in incident frequency, number of casualties, and geographical distribution.

## Datasets
Data of gun violence incidents was sourced from the Gun Violence Archive, encompassing over 260,000 detailed records of incidents. Key variables include incident date, location, number of people killed/injured, and incident characteristics. The dataset was downloaded from Kaggle.com

In addition, a .json shapefile of the US states was utilized in Python for the spatial analysis. 

## Tools used
I used Python within the Anaconda Navigator software environment, primarily utilizing Jupyter Notebook.

## Folders Structure
The folders are organized into the following directories:
+ 01 Project Management: Includes document about data set and project overview.
+ 02 Data: Subdivided into Original and Prepared Data, housing the unaltered dataset and the cleaned, analysis-ready data frames, respectively. Note: This folder is excluded on Github due to its size.
+ 03 Scripts: Comprises all Python codes utilized throughout the analysis.
+ 04 Analysis: Encompasses the saved visualizations.

## Tableau Storyboard
I created a storyboard on Tableau to perform further analysis on the data and present the visualizations on Tableau Public. The storyboard is available in the link:
